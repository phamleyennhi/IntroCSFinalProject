Introduction to Computer Science Final Project
Nhi Pham Le Yen, Vince Nguyen
December 2018


This project is a simplified game version of Plants vs. Zombies.

The setting of the game is set in front of D2. The campus cats will be the enemies, and we (NYUAD students - global leaders) will have to kill them all before they manage to get into D2 and steal all the food. 

There are 3 lanes. The cats will act as the zombies, moving from the right to the left of screen. NYUAD students are on the far left of the screen, trying to throw the Meal Club plates at the cats. 

Each time the cat is hit by the plate, its life bar, displayed on top of the cat, decreases until it hits 0 and the cat will die.

If a cat manages to touch the student, the student will die of cat allergy (Students also have hidden life bars). If a cat manages to set foot in D2, game over. 

There will be occasional campus dirhams falling from the sky. If the player collects them, they will be able to use them to buy more students.


Thank you for using our software!
